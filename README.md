firmware for the micromini board used for power monitoring.

this board acts as an i2c device (typically via w1, though not necessarily I guess). See doc/ for register map (generated by scripts in gen)

Many parts based on controller board firmware. Build with Makefile, requires arm-none-eabi-gcc 

Not implemented yet:
 - LoRaWAN (though basics there, ported from controller board)
 - SD card
 - Storing configuration on SPI flash
 - USB
